# My Bev Express

## Description

My Bev Express is a full MERN stack web application for clients of Beverage Express in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Users of the site can create an account, login/logout, create an order for delivery/pickup, update their information, and view a catalogue of previous orders. In addition to the tools of the MERN stack, this project uses FreeForm for customer contact, Semantic UI for a card carousel, and global state for the cart. 

## Deployment

For the purpose of this project, it is deployed on Heroku. You can access it at LINK. The project will eventually be deployed via a site hoster for my parents business.
